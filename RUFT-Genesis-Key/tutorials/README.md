# Tutorials for RUFT-Genesis-Key

## Welcome!

This directory contains tutorials to help you get started with the RUFT-Genesis-Key framework, its simulations, and analysis tools. Whether you're looking to understand the core concepts, run your own simulations, or analyze the results, these guides are designed to assist you.

## Planned Tutorials

The following tutorials are planned or under development. Check back for updates, or feel free to contribute if you have a tutorial idea!

1.  **`01_setting_up_environment.md`**
    *   **Goal:** Guide users through cloning the repository, installing Rust/Cargo, Python dependencies (NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, etc.), and any other necessary tools.
    *   **Content:** Step-by-step instructions for different operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows). How to verify the installation.

2.  **`02_understanding_project_structure.md`**
    *   **Goal:** Explain the layout of the `RUFT-Genesis-Key` repository, including the purpose of each main directory (`src`, `tests`, `simulations`, `analysis`, `config`, `docs`, `data`, `ethics`, `tutorials`).
    *   **Content:** Overview of key files like `Cargo.toml`, main `README.md`, and how components interact.

3.  **`03_running_the_simulations.md`**
    *   **Goal:** Provide instructions on how to run the 1D, 2D, and 3D cellular automata simulations.
    *   **Content:**
        *   Navigating to the `simulations/` directory.
        *   Basic Python execution: `python 1D_final.py`.
        *   Understanding simulation parameters within each script (e.g., `GRID_SIZE`, `TIME_STEPS`, `INITIAL_DENSITY`).
        *   How to modify parameters for different experiments.
        *   Expected outputs: console messages, plots, and `.npy` data files.
        *   Troubleshooting common issues (e.g., missing Python packages).

4.  **`04_interpreting_simulation_outputs.md`**
    *   **Goal:** Help users understand the data generated by the simulations.
    *   **Content:**
        *   Explanation of `_active_history.npy`, `_fused_history.npy`, `_entropy_history.npy`, `_resource_history.npy` files.
        *   How to load and view these `.npy` files in Python with NumPy.
        *   Understanding the generated plots (timeseries, phase space, etc.).

5.  **`05_using_analysis_scripts.md`**
    *   **Goal:** Guide users on how to use the Python scripts in the `analysis/` directory.
    *   **Content:**
        *   Prerequisites: Ensure simulation data (`.npy` files) are in the `simulations/` directory (or as configured in the analysis scripts).
        *   Running each analysis script: `python analysis_1d.py`, etc.
        *   Understanding the generated analysis plots (trends, periodicity, PSD, event detection).
        *   Interpreting the console output from the analysis scripts.
        *   How to customize analysis parameters within the scripts.

6.  **`06_extending_simulations_and_analysis.md` (Advanced)**
    *   **Goal:** Provide guidance for developers who want to modify or extend the existing simulations or create new analysis modules.
    *   **Content:**
        *   Overview of the class structures in simulation scripts (`CellAutomaton1D`, etc.).
        *   Tips for adding new rules, states, or parameters to simulations.
        *   Guidance on writing new analysis functions or scripts.
        *   Best practices for contributing code (linking to `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

7.  **`07_understanding_the_rust_framework_basics.md` (If applicable to CLI/core lib usage)**
    *   **Goal:** If the Rust core library/CLI is intended for direct user interaction beyond just building, this tutorial would cover that.
    *   **Content:**
        *   Building the Rust components: `cargo build`.
        *   Running the CLI: `target/release/ruft-genesis-key-cli --help`.
        *   Examples of CLI commands (if any are user-facing).
        *   Basic overview of the library structure in `src/lib.rs` for those interested in the Rust internals.

## Contribution

If you'd like to contribute a tutorial, or improve an existing one, please see `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the main project directory. We welcome clear, step-by-step guides that can help others use and understand RUFT-Genesis-Key.

When creating a new tutorial, please:
*   Use Markdown format (`.md`).
*   Follow a clear, numbered naming convention (e.g., `08_my_new_tutorial.md`).
*   Include a clear goal for the tutorial at the beginning.
*   Provide code snippets and expected outputs where appropriate.

We hope these tutorials are helpful!
