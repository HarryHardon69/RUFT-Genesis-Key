# Data Directory for RUFT-Genesis-Key

## Overview

This directory is intended to store data relevant to the RUFT-Genesis-Key project. This can include:

*   **Sample Input Data:** Examples of configuration files, initial state descriptions, or transaction lists that can be used to run simulations or test the framework.
*   **Simulation Outputs:** Raw or processed data generated by the various simulations (1D, 2D, 3D). While the `.npy` files from simulations are currently saved in the `simulations/` directory alongside the scripts for immediate reruns and ease of access during development, this `data/` directory could be a place for:
    *   Curated datasets from specific simulation runs.
    *   Outputs from multiple runs for comparative analysis.
    *   Data converted to more universally accessible formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, HDF5) if needed for external tools.
*   **Analysis Results:** Processed data resulting from running the analysis scripts in the `analysis/` directory. This could include statistical summaries, extracted features, or model outputs.
*   **Benchmarks:** Results from performance benchmarks of the core library or CLI application.
*   **Reference Data:** Any external datasets used for comparison, validation, or calibration of the models.

## Directory Structure

The structure within this `data/` directory can be organized based on the type of data or the source simulation/analysis. For example:

```
data/
├── sample_inputs/
│   ├── sample_config_A.toml
│   └── initial_state_X.json
├── simulation_outputs_1D/
│   ├── run_alpha_active_history.npy
│   └── run_alpha_entropy_history.npy
├── simulation_outputs_2D/
│   └── some_specific_run_fused_cores.csv
├── analysis_products/
│   ├── 1D_stability_summary.txt
│   └── 2D_phase_space_clusters.json
└── benchmarks/
    └── performance_v0_1_0.txt
```

## Data Formats

*   **NumPy arrays (`.npy`):** Commonly used for numerical data from simulations due to efficiency.
*   **CSV (`.csv`):** For tabular data, easily readable and widely compatible.
*   **JSON (`.json`):** For structured data, good for configurations or nested information.
*   **Text files (`.txt`, `.md`):** For logs, summaries, or textual data.
*   **HDF5 (`.h5`, `.hdf5`):** For large, complex datasets, especially if hierarchical storage is needed.

## Notes

*   **Large Files:** For very large data files, consider using Git LFS (Large File Storage) or storing them externally and providing download links or instructions here. Add patterns for large data files to the main `.gitignore` file.
*   **Data Provenance:** When storing generated data, it's good practice to include information about its origin (e.g., which simulation script, what parameters, version of the code). This can be in a separate metadata file or embedded in the filename/directory structure.
*   **Cleanliness:** Regularly review the contents of this directory. Temporary or intermediate data files should ideally be handled by scripts and not committed unless they are part of a specific, reproducible workflow.

This `README.md` serves as a guide to understanding the purpose and organization of the `data/` directory.
