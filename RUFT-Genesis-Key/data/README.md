# Data Directory

This directory contains key HDF5 (`.h5`) data files generated by the simulations in this repository. These files serve as proof-of-concept and can be used with the `analysis/` scripts without needing to re-run the computationally intensive simulations.

## Key Data Files:

### `output_fusion_v3.2.h5`
- **Source:** Generated by `simulations/2D_fusion_final.py`.
- **Contains:** The full time-series data for the "Chimera Reactor Core" simulation. Includes the evolution of the `U` (Energy Density) field and the calculated history of the Energy Confinement Time (`tau_E`).
- **Use with:** `analysis/analysis_2d.py` to generate animations and `analysis/analysis_gw.py` to derive the gravitational wave signature.

### `output_portal_v2.1.h5`
- **Source:** Generated by `simulations/RUFT_2D_Portal_v2.1.py`.
- **Contains:** The full time-series data for the "Entangled Aperture" simulation. Includes the evolution of both the `phi` and `U` fields.
- **Use with:** `analysis/analysis_portal.py` to generate an animation of the interference patterns.

These files can be explored with tools like HDFView or the `h5py` library in Python.
