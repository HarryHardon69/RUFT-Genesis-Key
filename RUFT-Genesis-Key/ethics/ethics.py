# RUFT v5.0 - Genesis Key Release
# Module: The Ethical Core (v1.0)
#
# Description:
# This file is a DESIGN PATTERN, not a functional library.
# It provides a template for implementing the ethical principles of the
# Clay Covenant in any project derived from RUFT.
#
# The goal is not to create a restrictive AI, but to provide a clear
# and explicit checklist that forces creators to consider the profound
# implications of their work.
